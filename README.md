## 🔍 Advanced Bug Detection

The system performs static code analysis and detects:
- Security vulnerabilities (High severity)
- Performance issues (Medium severity)
- Code smells (Low severity)
- Best practice violations

Each issue is categorized and assigned a severity level to help developers prioritize fixes.
